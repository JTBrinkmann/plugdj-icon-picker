# Plug.dj Icon Picker
A small utility to open a popup with the plug.dj icons and help you find their CSS class. This is meant for developers and those who want to change icons for their room theme.


## Usage
Create a bookmark with the following address (on Chrome and Firefox you can just select the text and drag'n'drop it to your bookmarks bar)
```js
javascript:$.getScript('https://rawgit.com/JTBrinkmann/plugdj-icon-picker/master/plugdj-icon-picker.js');void(8)
```
This bookmark will not open a page but instead execute the code to open the icon picker. It's also called a "bookmarklet".

Go to plug.dj (the dashboard or any room) if you're not already there, and click the bookmarklet. You might have to allow popups for plug.dj


## Notes
If you don't get any popup, check the URL bar for any popup blocking warnings. Click them and allow popups for plug.dj

If you get a blank popup, close it and try again.

The logos at the bottom don't work because they are not "icons".
